## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability in PyCompiler ARK++, please report it responsibly.

### How to Report

**DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.

Instead, please use one of these secure channels:

1. **GitHub Security Advisories** (Preferred)
   - Go to the [Security tab](https://github.com/raidos23/pycompiler-ark/security) of our repository
   - Click "Report a vulnerability"
   - Fill out the form with detailed information

2. **Email** (Alternative)
   - Send an email to: ague.samuel27@gmail.com
   - Use PGP encryption if possible (key available on request)
   - Include "SECURITY" in the subject line

### What to Include

Please provide as much information as possible:

- **Description**: Clear description of the vulnerability
- **Impact**: Potential impact and attack scenarios
- **Reproduction**: Step-by-step instructions to reproduce
- **Affected Versions**: Which versions are affected
- **Environment**: OS, Python version, dependencies
- **Proof of Concept**: Code or screenshots (if applicable)
- **Suggested Fix**: If you have ideas for remediation

### Response Timeline

We are committed to responding quickly to security reports:

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Triage**: Within 5 business days
- **Status Updates**: Weekly until resolved
- **Resolution**: Target 30 days for critical issues

### Disclosure Process

1. **Report Received**: We acknowledge receipt and begin investigation
2. **Validation**: We confirm and assess the vulnerability
3. **Fix Development**: We develop and test a fix
4. **Coordinated Disclosure**: We work with you on disclosure timing
5. **Public Release**: We release the fix and security advisory
6. **Recognition**: We credit you in our security advisory (if desired)

## Security Measures

### Code Security

- **Static Analysis**: Automated security scanning with Bandit
- **Dependency Scanning**: Regular audits with pip-audit and Safety
- **Code Review**: All changes require review before merging
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive input sanitization
- **Secure Defaults**: Security-first configuration defaults

### Plugin Security

- **Sandboxing**: Plugins run in restricted environments
- **Permission Model**: Explicit permissions for sensitive operations
- **Code Signing**: Verification of plugin authenticity
- **Audit Trail**: Logging of all plugin activities
- **Resource Limits**: CPU, memory, and I/O restrictions

### Build Security

- **Reproducible Builds**: Deterministic build process
- **Supply Chain**: SBOM generation and dependency verification
- **Code Signing**: All releases are cryptographically signed
- **Integrity Checks**: SHA256 checksums for all artifacts

### Runtime Security

- **Process Isolation**: Subprocess sandboxing and timeouts
- **Log Redaction**: Automatic removal of sensitive information
- **Secure Communication**: TLS for all network operations
- **Privilege Separation**: Minimal required permissions

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

- **Keep Updated**: Always use the latest supported version
- **Verify Downloads**: Check signatures and checksums
- **Plugin Sources**: Only install plugins from trusted sources
- **Environment**: Run in isolated environments when possible
- **Monitoring**: Monitor logs for suspicious activity

### For Plugin Developers

- **Input Validation**: Validate all inputs thoroughly
- **Error Handling**: Don't expose sensitive information in errors
- **Dependencies**: Keep dependencies updated and minimal
- **Permissions**: Request only necessary permissions
- **Documentation**: Document security considerations

### For Contributors

- **Secure Development**: Follow secure coding practices
- **Testing**: Include security test cases
- **Dependencies**: Justify new dependencies
- **Secrets**: Never commit secrets or credentials
- **Review**: Participate in security-focused code reviews

## Known Security Considerations

### Plugin System
- Plugins have access to the file system and network
- Plugin code is executed in the main Python process
- Malicious plugins could potentially access sensitive data

### Subprocess Execution
- Compilation engines are executed as subprocesses
- Subprocess output is captured and processed
- Timeout mechanisms prevent runaway processes

### Configuration Files
- Configuration files may contain sensitive information
- File permissions should be restricted appropriately
- Avoid storing secrets in configuration files

## Security Updates

### Notification Channels
- **GitHub Security Advisories**: Primary notification method
- **Release Notes**: Security fixes documented in CHANGELOG.md
- **Mailing List**: ague.samuel27@gmail.com (planned)

### Update Process
1. Security fixes are prioritized and fast-tracked
2. Patches are backported to supported versions
3. Emergency releases may skip normal release process
4. Users are notified through multiple channels

## Compliance and Standards

### Standards Adherence
- **OWASP**: Following OWASP secure coding practices
- **CWE**: Addressing Common Weakness Enumeration items
- **NIST**: Aligning with NIST Cybersecurity Framework

### Audit and Assessment
- Regular security assessments of codebase
- Third-party security reviews for major releases
- Penetration testing of plugin system
